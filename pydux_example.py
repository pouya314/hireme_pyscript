# This is a reducer, a pure function with (state, action) => state signature.
# It describes how an action transforms the state into the next state.
#
# The shape of the state is up to you: it can be a primitive, an array, an object,
# or even an frozendict data structure [1]. The only important part is that you should
# not mutate the state object, but return a new object if the state changes.
#

# In this example, we use a `if` statement and strings, but you can use a
# helper that follows a different convention if it makes sense for your
# project.
